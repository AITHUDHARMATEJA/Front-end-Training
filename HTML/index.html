     <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and <hr />typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing <br> Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>

        Dearest Caro,
        
        I was happy to see your letter, and I <span style="color:red">loved</span>loved your idea. I have been wanting to go on a trip with you for a long time, and I think both of us can finally make time to plan and make it happen.
        
        I have a list of places that I thought would be fun to visit. I also do <span style="color:red">loved</span> a list of things I would like to do on our trip. I am too scared of heights, and I know you are too, but I have always wanted to try out bungee jumping with you. Let me know what you think about it. We can also find affordable and beautiful places to stay, and I am sure we can chart it all out. I cannot wait to go on this adventure with you. I know it is a secret to be kept since it is going to be just us, and that makes it all the more exciting. I know for sure that it is going to be worth it too.
        
        I will make sure that I meet you next weekend and make plans for the trip. It would definitely be difficult to get our parents to allow us on this trip, but letâ€™s try hard and make this work. See you soon.
        
        Love,
